    "The long-standing rationalist tradition in moral psychology emphasizes the role of reason in moral judgment. A more recent trend places increased emphasis on emotion. Although both reason and emotion are likely to play important roles in moral judgment, relatively little is known about their neural correlates, the nature of their interaction, and the factors that modulate their respective behavioral influences in the context of moral judgment. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using moral dilemmas as probes, we apply the methods of cognitive neuroscience to the study of moral judgment. We argue that moral dilemmas vary systematically in the extent to which they engage emotional processing and that these variations in emotional engagement influence moral judgment These results may shed light on some puzzling patterns in moral judgment observed by contemporary philosophers.",

    "Social observation increases deontological judgments in moral dilemmas",
  abstract:
    "A concern for positive reputation is one of the core motivations underlying various social behaviors in humans.The present study investigated how experimentally induced reputation concern modulates judgments in moraldilemmas. In a mixed-design experiment, participants were randomly assigned to the observed vs. the controlgroup and responded to a series of trolley-type moral dilemmas either in the presence or absence of observers,respectively. While no significant baseline difference in personality traits and moral decision tendency werefound across two groups of participants, our analyses revealed that social observation promoted deontologicaljudgments especially for moral dilemmas involving direct bodily harm (i.e., personal moral dilemmas), yet withan overall decrease in decision confidence and significant prolongation of reaction time. Moreover, participantsin the observed group, but not in the control group, showed the increased sensitivities towards warmth vs.competence traits words in the lexical decision task performed after the moral dilemma task. Ourfindingssuggest that reputation concern, once triggered by the presence of potentially judgmental others, could activate aculturally dominant norm of warmth in various social contexts. This could, in turn, induce a series of goal-directed processes for self-presentation of warmth, leading to increased deontological judgments in moral di-lemmas. The results of the present study provide insights into the reputational consequences of moral decisionsthat merit further exploration.",

  text: `1. Introduction
  1.1. The trolley problem: various determinants of judgments in moraldilemmasThe study of moral dilemmas has been one of the most fruitful ve-nues for investigating the cognitive and motivational structure ofmorality. Markedly, a particular strand of research based on the“trolleyproblem ({{Thomson, 1976}})”has garnered much interest from empiricalminds across disciplines. In a typical trolley-type dilemma, people areasked to respond to a series of vignettes that pit a Kantian imperativeagainst the consequential benefits expected from its violation ({{Greene,Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001}}) (e.g.,“Is it appropriateto pull the lever and sacrifice a person to savefive people from a run-away trolley?”). Coupled with recent advances in neuroscientificmethodologies (e.g., Functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI),this now-famous portrayal of deontological and utilitarian schools ofthought has become a widely-cited reference for the view that moraldecision making is a dynamic process involving both affective andcognitive valuations in the brain ({{Greene et al., 2001}}; {{Hutcherson,Montaser-Kouhsari, Woodward, & Rangel, 2015}}).The growing recognition of morality as a multifaceted constructstands in contrast to the conventional approaches that largely focusedon the role of conscious reasoning in moral judgments ({{Haidt, 2008}}).While most rationality-centered models in philosophy and psychologypostulate the universal norms or developmentally canalized moral rulesas key anchors for moral judgments across individuals and social con-texts ({{Piaget, 1948}}), a series of empirical investigations utilizing trolley-type dilemmas has revealed rather the opposite picture. For example,researchers have shown that people's characteristic decisions in moraldilemmas are not solely driven by the rigid implementation of moralprinciples. Instead, they are affected by seemingly-extraneous variablessuch as gender ({{Friesdorf, Conway, & Gawronski, 2015}}), personality({{Bartels & Pizarro, 2011}}; {{Gleichgerrcht & Young, 2013}}), culturalbackground ({{Han, Glover, & Jeong, 2014}}), and genetic makeups ofindividuals ({{Bernhard et al., 2016}}). Evidence also suggests that eventransient changes in mood ({{Valdesolo & DeSteno, 2006}}), cognitive state({{Amit & Greene, 2012}}; {{Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, & Cohen,2008}}), and hormonal balance ({{Crockett, Clark, Hauser, & Robbins,2010}}) could alter the responses to the identical set of moral vignettes.`,
