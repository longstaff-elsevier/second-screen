  abstract:
    "The long-standing rationalist tradition in moral psychology emphasizes the role of reason in moral judgment. A more recent trend places increased emphasis on emotion. Although both reason and emotion are likely to play important roles in moral judgment, relatively little is known about their neural correlates, the nature of their interaction, and the factors that modulate their respective behavioral influences in the context of moral judgment. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using moral dilemmas as probes, we apply the methods of cognitive neuroscience to the study of moral judgment. We argue that moral dilemmas vary systematically in the extent to which they engage emotional processing and that these variations in emotional engagement influence moral judgment These results may shed light on some puzzling patterns in moral judgment observed by contemporary philosophers.",

  abstract:
    "© 2015 the authors. Moral judgment often requires making difficult tradeoffs (e.g., is it appropriate to torture to save the lives of innocents at risk?). Previous research suggests that both emotional appraisals and more deliberative utilitarian appraisals influence such judgments and that these appraisals often conflict. However, it is unclear how these different types of appraisals are represented in the brain, or how they are integrated into an overall moral judgment. We addressed these questions using an fMRI paradigm in which human subjects provide separate emotional and utilitarian appraisals for different potential actions, and then make difficult moral judgments constructed from combinations of these actions. We found that anterior cingulate, insula, and superior temporal gyrus correlated with emotional appraisals, whereas temporoparietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex correlated with utilitarian appraisals. Overall moral value judgments were represented in an anterior portion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Critically, the pattern of responses and functional interactions between these three sets of regions are consistent with a model in which emotional and utilitarian appraisals are computed independently and in parallel, and passed to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex where they are integrated into an overall moral value judgment.",

  abstract:
    "Moral psychology is a rapidly growing field with two principle lineages. The main line began with Jean Piaget and includes developmental psychologists who have studied the acquisition of moral concepts and reasoning. The alternative line began in the 1990s with a new synthesis of evolutionary, neurological, and social-psychological research in which the central phenomena are moral emotions and intuitions. In this essay, I show how both of these lines have been shaped by an older debate between two 19th century narratives about modernity: one celebrating the liberation of individuals, the other mourning the loss of community and moral authority. I suggest that both lines of moral psychology have limited themselves to the moral domain prescribed by the liberation narrative, and so one future step for moral psychology should be to study alternative moral perspectives, particularly religious and politically conservative ones in which morality is, in part, about protecting groups, institutions, and souls. © 2008, Association for Psychological Science.

  abstract:
    "© 2015 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc The principle of deontology states that the morality of an action depends on its consistency with moral norms; the principle of utilitarianism implies that the morality of an action depends on its consequences. Previous research suggests that deontological judgments are shaped by affective processes, whereas utilitarian judgments are guided by cognitive processes. The current research used process dissociation (PD) to independently assess deontological and utilitarian inclinations in women and men. A meta-analytic re-analysis of 40 studies with 6,100 participants indicated that men showed a stronger preference for utilitarian over deontological judgments than women when the two principles implied conflicting decisions (d = 0.52). PD further revealed that women exhibited stronger deontological inclinations than men (d = 0.57), while men exhibited only slightly stronger utilitarian inclinations than women (d = 0.10). The findings suggest that gender differences in moral dilemma judgments are due to differences in affective responses to harm rather than cognitive evaluations of outcomes.",

    "This study compares the neural substrate of moral decision making processes between Korean and American participants. By comparison with Americans, Korean participants showed increased activity in the right putamen associated with socio-intuitive processes and right superior frontal gyrus associated with cognitive control processes under a moral-personal condition, and in the right postcentral sulcus associated with mental calculation in familiar contexts under a moral-impersonal condition. On the other hand, American participants showed a significantly higher degree of activity in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) associated with conflict resolution under the moral-personal condition, and in the right medial frontal gyrus (MFG) associated with simple cognitive branching in non-familiar contexts under the moral-impersonal condition when a more lenient threshold was applied, than Korean participants. These findings support the ideas of the interactions between the cultural background, education, and brain development, proposed in the field of cultural psychology and educational psychology. The study introduces educational implications relevant to moral psychologists and educators.",

  abstract:
    "© The Author (2016). Published by Oxford University Press. Moral judgments are produced through the coordinated interaction of multiple neural systems, each of which relies on a characteristic set of neurotransmitters. Genes that produce or regulate these neurotransmitters may have distinctive influences on moral judgment. Two studies examined potential genetic influences on moral judgment using dilemmas that reliably elicit competing automatic and controlled responses, generated by dissociable neural systems. Study 1 (N = 228) examined 49 common variants (SNPs) within 10 candidate genes and identified a nominal association between a polymorphism (rs237889) of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and variation in deontological vs utilitarian moral judgment (that is, judgments favoring individual rights vs the greater good). An association was likewise observed for rs1042615 of the arginine vasopressin receptor gene (AVPR1A). Study 2 (N = 322) aimed to replicate these findings using the aforementioned dilemmas as well as a new set of structurally similar medical dilemmas. Study 2 failed to replicate the association with AVPR1A, but replicated the OXTR finding using both the original and new dilemmas. Together, these findings suggest that moral judgment is influenced by variation in the oxytocin receptor gene and, more generally, that single genetic polymorphisms can have a detectable effect on complex decision processes.",

  abstract:
    "We conducted three experiments indicating that characteristically deontological judgments-here, disapproving of sacrificing one person for the greater good of others-are preferentially supported by visual imagery. Experiment 1 used two matched working memory tasks-one visual, one verbal-to identify individuals with relatively visual cognitive styles and individuals with relatively verbal cognitive styles. Individuals with more visual cognitive styles made more deontological judgments. Experiment 2 showed that visual interference, relative to verbal interference and no interference, decreases deontological judgment. Experiment 3 indicated that these effects are due to people's tendency to visualize the harmful means (sacrificing one person) more than the beneficial end (saving others). These results suggest a specific role for visual imagery in moral judgment: When people consider sacrificing someone as a means to an end, visual imagery preferentially supports the judgment that the ends do not justify the means. These results suggest an integration of the dual-process theory of moral judgment with construal-level theory. © The Author(s) 2012.",

    "Traditional theories of moral development emphasize the role of controlled cognition in mature moral judgment, while a more recent trend emphasizes intuitive and emotional processes. Here we test a dual-process theory synthesizing these perspectives. More specifically, our theory associates utilitarian moral judgment (approving of harmful actions that maximize good consequences) with controlled cognitive processes and associates non-utilitarian moral judgment with automatic emotional responses. Consistent with this theory, we find that a cognitive load manipulation selectively interferes with utilitarian judgment. This interference effect provides direct evidence for the influence of controlled cognitive processes in moral judgment, and utilitarian moral judgment more specifically.",

  abstract:
    "Aversive emotional reactions to real or imagined social harms infuse moral judgment and motivate prosocial behavior. Here, we show that the neurotransmitter serotonin directly alters both moral judgment and behavior through increasing subjects' aversion to personally harming others. We enhanced serotonin in healthy volunteers with citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and contrasted its effects with both a pharmacological control treatment and a placebo on tests of moral judgment and behavior. We measured the drugs' effects on moral judgment in a set of moral 'dilemmas' pitting utilitarian outcomes (e.g., saving five lives) against highly aversive harmful actions (e.g., killing an innocent person). Enhancing serotonin made subjects more likely to judge harmful actions as forbidden, but only in cases where harms were emotionally salient. This harm-avoidant bias after citalopram was also evident in behavior during the ultimatum game, in which subjects decide to accept or reject fair or unfair monetary offers from another player. Rejecting unfair offers enforces a fairness norm but also harms the other player financially. Enhancing serotonin made subjects less likely to reject unfair offers. Furthermore, the prosocial effects of citalopram varied as a function of trait empathy. Individuals high in trait empathy showed stronger effects of citalopram on moral judgment and behavior than individuals low in trait empathy. Together, these findings provide unique evidence that serotonin could promote prosocial behavior by enhancing harm aversion, a prosocial sentiment that directly affects both moral judgment and moral behavior.",

    "Social observation increases deontological judgments in moral dilemmas",
  abstract:
    "A concern for positive reputation is one of the core motivations underlying various social behaviors in humans.The present study investigated how experimentally induced reputation concern modulates judgments in moraldilemmas. In a mixed-design experiment, participants were randomly assigned to the observed vs. the controlgroup and responded to a series of trolley-type moral dilemmas either in the presence or absence of observers,respectively. While no significant baseline difference in personality traits and moral decision tendency werefound across two groups of participants, our analyses revealed that social observation promoted deontologicaljudgments especially for moral dilemmas involving direct bodily harm (i.e., personal moral dilemmas), yet withan overall decrease in decision confidence and significant prolongation of reaction time. Moreover, participantsin the observed group, but not in the control group, showed the increased sensitivities towards warmth vs.competence traits words in the lexical decision task performed after the moral dilemma task. Ourfindingssuggest that reputation concern, once triggered by the presence of potentially judgmental others, could activate aculturally dominant norm of warmth in various social contexts. This could, in turn, induce a series of goal-directed processes for self-presentation of warmth, leading to increased deontological judgments in moral di-lemmas. The results of the present study provide insights into the reputational consequences of moral decisionsthat merit further exploration.",

  text: `1. Introduction
  1.1. The trolley problem: various determinants of judgments in moraldilemmasThe study of moral dilemmas has been one of the most fruitful ve-nues for investigating the cognitive and motivational structure ofmorality. Markedly, a particular strand of research based on the“trolleyproblem ({{Thomson, 1976}})”has garnered much interest from empiricalminds across disciplines. In a typical trolley-type dilemma, people areasked to respond to a series of vignettes that pit a Kantian imperativeagainst the consequential benefits expected from its violation ({{Greene,Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, & Cohen, 2001}}) (e.g.,“Is it appropriateto pull the lever and sacrifice a person to savefive people from a run-away trolley?”). Coupled with recent advances in neuroscientificmethodologies (e.g., Functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI),this now-famous portrayal of deontological and utilitarian schools ofthought has become a widely-cited reference for the view that moraldecision making is a dynamic process involving both affective andcognitive valuations in the brain ({{Greene et al., 2001}}; {{Hutcherson,Montaser-Kouhsari, Woodward, & Rangel, 2015}}).The growing recognition of morality as a multifaceted constructstands in contrast to the conventional approaches that largely focusedon the role of conscious reasoning in moral judgments ({{Haidt, 2008}}).While most rationality-centered models in philosophy and psychologypostulate the universal norms or developmentally canalized moral rulesas key anchors for moral judgments across individuals and social con-texts ({{Piaget, 1948}}), a series of empirical investigations utilizing trolley-type dilemmas has revealed rather the opposite picture. For example,researchers have shown that people's characteristic decisions in moraldilemmas are not solely driven by the rigid implementation of moralprinciples. Instead, they are affected by seemingly-extraneous variablessuch as gender ({{Friesdorf, Conway, & Gawronski, 2015}}), personality({{Bartels & Pizarro, 2011}}; {{Gleichgerrcht & Young, 2013}}), culturalbackground ({{Han, Glover, & Jeong, 2014}}), and genetic makeups ofindividuals ({{Bernhard et al., 2016}}). Evidence also suggests that eventransient changes in mood ({{Valdesolo & DeSteno, 2006}}), cognitive state({{Amit & Greene, 2012}}; {{Greene, Morelli, Lowenberg, Nystrom, & Cohen,2008}}), and hormonal balance ({{Crockett, Clark, Hauser, & Robbins,2010}}) could alter the responses to the identical set of moral vignettes.`,
